# Case study
Jamie at Adventure Works wants to improve the company’s product inventory file. This includes making the data easier to read and locate. You are part of the team creating the inventory for submission to a management review. You are familiarizing yourself with the content in the inventory file and decide to use the Sort feature to organize the data to suit your requirements.

# Data Sorting Overview:

# 1. Initial Setup:
  ⇒ Applied a yellow background to cells A32 to I32 as a reference point.
  
# 2. Sorting by Product Name:
  ⇒ Sorted Product Name alphabetically (A-Z), and reversed the order (Z-A) to view in descending order.

# 3. Sorting by Date:
  ⇒ Sorted by Date to display the oldest entries first (ascending order).

# 4. Sorting by Supplier:
  ⇒ Sorted data by Supplier in alphabetical order.

# 5. Multi-Level Sorting:
Sorted first by Supplier and then by Units in Stock (largest to smallest) for better categorization.

# Conclusion:

The sorting process has effectively organized the product data by key criteria, such as Product Name, Date, Supplier, and Units in Stock, enabling easier analysis and clearer insights. By using both single-level and multi-level sorting techniques, we have streamlined the presentation of the inventory data, ensuring that stakeholders can quickly access the most relevant information and make informed decisions based on an organized and structured dataset.
